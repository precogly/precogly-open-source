# ðŸ¦‰ Precogly
## Explainable Â· Trustworthy Â· Standards-Aligned Threat Modeling for Everyone

Threat modeling shouldnâ€™t feel like paperwork.
Precogly is an open-source, AI-powered platform that helps teams reason about security risks the way experienced AppSec engineers do â€” only faster and with full transparency.

At its heart, Precogly uses a network of agentic systems â€” small, focused agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) _and_ rules engines.
Each agent takes on a clear role: one reads your architecture, another identifies STRIDE threats, another maps to CAPEC attack patterns, and another links to MITRE ATT&CK or NIST controls.

## Core Principles

### Explainable

You can always see why Precogly said what it said.
Every threat, mitigation, and recommendation includes a reasoning trace â€” the frameworks, data, and rules that led to that conclusion.

### Trustworthy
Precogly grounds its insights in real-world security data like CVE, MITRE ATT&CK, CAPEC, and OWASP guidance.
It pairs the creativity of LLMs with deterministic rule logic, producing results that are fast and credible - on par with what would be produced by a seasoned security expert.

### Standards-Aligned
Precogly speaks the same language as your security programs:
STRIDE, CAPEC, MITRE ATT&CK and D3FEND, NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, TM-BOM etc. 
That means instant compatibility with compliance tools, DevSecOps pipelines, and audit workflows.

### Get Involved

Precogly is community-driven. Whether youâ€™re into AppSec, AI safety, or developer tooling â€” contributions are welcome.
Join the discussion, file issues, or help shape new agents and rules.
